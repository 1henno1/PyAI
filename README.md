# PyAI
An AI written in Python with learning capabilities
The AI takes user input in the python shell and converts it into facts, which it keeps in a dictionary. To do this, it removes punctuation and converts to lower case and then filters out information based on the verb used.
It can be questioned on facts it has been told (recognises question marks).
