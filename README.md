# PyAI
An AI written in Python with learning capabilities
The AI takes user input in the python shell and converts it into facts, which it keeps in a dictionary stored in the JSON file "objects.json" (ignored). To do this, it removes punctuation and converts to lower case and then filters out information based on the verb used.
It can be questioned on facts it has been told (recognises question marks).
